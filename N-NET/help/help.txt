Welcome to the Neural Network Help File! This guide will walk you through the essentials of using the neural network to perform machine learning tasks in Python.

1. Introduction:
The neural network is a powerful machine learning algorithm inspired by the human brain's structure. It consists of interconnected layers of artificial neurons that can learn patterns and make predictions from data. Neural networks are widely used in various applications, including image recognition, natural language processing, and regression problems.
